Welcome fellow web developers!

Hopefully you have already figured out that this site is satire. Or, if you
haven't... surprise!  You are probably in here to see if the code for this site
is just as reminiscent of the 1990s as the design is. Sadly (or not-so-sadly),
it is not. At least not entirely.

The thought of creating a purely HTML (aka no-CSS) website was very tempting.
I mean, who doesn't love a good <frame> or designing all of my table borders
(or lack thereof) directly inside <table>? And who doesn't have fond memories
of using the <font> tag for all of your typography needs.  Oh! And do you
remember border="0" on <img> tags? This girl does!

But seriously, I decided to be a little practical with the code on this site
because, frankly, a bunch of these tags and attributes no longer have browser
support. The look and feel was more important than the code in this case.

But I did throw in a some goodies, nonetheless, just for old time's sake.

          <p>You are probably wondering why there are coffee cups all over this site.  You could assume that this means I like coffee.</p>
          <p>Don't assume that. The coffee is a lie.</p>
          <p>I actually can't stand coffee. Even with cream and sugar, it's still pretty terrible.  Sorry, folks.  I'm a tea girl all the way.</p>
          <p>However, the donut is definitely not a lie. Donuts are amazing.</p>
